      As usual see the manual for further information.<br>
2004-09-28 Multi threaded building see option -j, now you can use your multi CPU machine.
      Building using <a href="http://distcc.samba.org/">distcc</a> see option -distcc, now
      you can distribute the build process across multiple computers.
      New file release V1 RC3<br>
2004-08-25 Using Getopt to read options and arguments, enabling the definition of custom options like

      See the manual for further information.<br>
2004-05-02 Added progress information when compiling, its a first step towards distributed compiling (it now
      generates a list of all files that need to be compiled).<br>
2004-03-15 Added an autoTarget function (works under linux(tested on Debian)
      and windows(most likely just Cygwin)) and a tiny test project demonstrating buildpp, also the manual has been updated.<br>
2004-02-23 Web page created.
 
<h2>Getting buildpp</h2>
Use the following line in your shell to get the latest version of buildpp or simply get a file release.<br>
<br>
<em>cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/buildpp checkout buildpp</em><br>
<br>
<h2>Manual</h2>
Here is a link to the HTML documentation generated by the source in CVS.
I will try to keep it up to date with the  CVS source:<br>
<a href="buildpp.html">buildpp manual</a><br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
Not really need it is just a perl script, copy it somewhere convenient...<br>
Distribute it with your source, stand on your head, make strange noises, or:<br>
<br>
<em>cd</em> to the buildpp directory.<br>
type <em>make install</em>.<br>
The "make install" copies the buildpp.pl to /usr/bin/ using cp<br>
As such it probably just works under Unix/Linux like environments. If it should fail, you may copy the file manually
to somewhere in you path.<br>
I recently tried "make install" under cygwin, and it succeed, your mileage may vary...<br>  
If you just type make it will additionally try to build the manual pages for buildpp,
this requires yodl2man and yodl2html part of the <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jantien/yodl/">yodl package</a>.Note: the manual pages are currently not installed as they are incomplete.<br>
If you type <em>make test</em> instead of <em>make install</em> it will try
to build a dummy program using buildpp, this additionally requires gcc<br>
<h2>Tips</h2>
Under Windows I strongly recommend using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> as it provides a Linux likeenvironment, including perl and a decent shell.
And if you are developing non GPL things <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> as the compiler, other compilers
are usable as well, but MinGW is free.<br>
<h2>Future features (planed ones)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write a better manual.</li>
<li>Warnings when two files with the same name is detected.</li>
<li>Path exclusion option for the modulelist.</li>
<li>"Clock skew" detection (files from the future).</li>
<li>Fix the -j2 link crash on MacOSX.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Support BuildPP</h2>
I really would like to know if anyone besides me, my friends and the guys at work uses buildpp.<br>
I will continue the develop buildpp even if no one but myself used buildpp,
however I probably won't get around
writing a nicer manual if no one finds buildpp the least bit interesting.<br>
You don't have to send me any money (no one should pay money for such a small piece of software
(not that I would mind getting money :) ).
So just send me an e-mail if you use buildpp, not that you are forced to.<br>
I you want I will include a link to your project at the bottom of this page.
<h2>Projects using BuildPP</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.aminova.dk">SENTINEL PaperScan</a> paper quality control software, the development of buildpp actually started here when a problem was encountered with <em>make</em> and lots of .o files
(only under windows)</li>
<li><a href="http://talpa.dk">My masters</a> a Physics engine.</li>
<li><a href="http://software.tuxtail.org/software.php">PeguinFight</a> a playable clone of an old C64 game called DogFight.</li>
<li><a href="http://talpa.dk">A OpenGL Menu library</a> derived from PenguinFight.</li>
