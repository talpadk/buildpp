<h1>News</h1>
2004-06-27 Minor change readConfigFile now dies if there is an error in the file, previously it just continued without a single warning.<br> 
2004-06-25 Added $lazyLinking variable and //#lazylinking on/off, allowing you not to specify the //#link comments.
           Se the manual for further information.<br>
2004-03-15 Added an autoTarget function (works under linux(tested on Debian)
           and windows(most likely just Cygwin)) and a tiny test project demonstrating buildpp,
           also the manual has been updated.<br>
2004-02-23 Web page created.

<h1>Getting buildpp</h1>
A somewhat current version may be downloaded from the SourceForge page,
it however don't contain a complete manual.<br>
Until I get my act together you may download a current version of buildpp using CVS.<br>
Use the following line in your shell to get buildpp.<br>
<br>
<em>cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/buildpp checkout buildpp</em><br>
<br>
<h1>Manual</h1>
One of the things missing before creating a file release is a complete manual for buildpp.
Not that I think buildpp is difficult to use but then again I wrote it...<br>
<br>
Here is a link to the HTML documentation generated by the source in CVS.
I will try to keep it up to date with the  CVS source:<br>
<a href="http://buildpp.sourceforge.net/buildpp.html">buildpp manual</a><br>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<em>cd</em> to the buildpp directory.<br>
type <em>make install</em>.<br>
The "make install" copies the buildpp.pl to /usr/bin/ using cp<br>
As such it probably just works under Unix/Linux like environments. If it should fail, you may copy the file manually
to somewhere in you path.<br>
I recently tried "make install" under cygwin, and it succeed, your mileage may vary...<br>  
If you just type make it will additionally try to build the manual pages for buildpp,
this requires yodl2man and yodl2html part of the <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Ejantien/yodl/">yodl package</a>.
Note: the manual pages are currently not installed as they are incomplete.<br>
If you type <em>make test</em> instead of <em>make install</em> it will try
to build a dummy program using buildpp, this additionally requires gcc<br>
<h1>Tips</h1>
Under Windows I strongly recommend using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> as it provides a Linux like
environment, including perl and a decent shell. 
And if you are developing non GPL things <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> as the compiler, other compilers
are usable as well, but MinGW is free.<br>
