<h1>Getting buildpp</h1>
Until I get my act together you may download buildpp using CVS.<br>
Use the following line in your shell to get buildpp.<br>
<br>
<em>cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/buildpp checkout buildpp</em><br>
<br>
<h1>Manual</h1>
One of the things missing before creating a file release is a complete manual for buildpp.
Not that I think buildpp is difficult to use but then again I wrote it...<br>
<br>
Here is a link to the HTML documentation generated by the source in CVS.
I will try to keep it up to date with the  CVS source:<br>
<a href="buildpp.html">buildpp manual</a><br>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<em>cd</em> to the buildpp directory.<br>
type <em>make install</em>.<br>
The "make install" copies the buildpp.pl to /usr/bin/ using cp<br>
As such it probably just works under Unix/Linux like environments. If it should fail, you may copy the file manually
to somewhere in you path.<br>
If you just type make it will additionally try to build the manual pages for buildpp,
this requires yodl2man and yodl2html part of the <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jantien/yodl/">yodl package</a>.
Note: the manual pages are currently not installed as they are incomplete.<br>
<h1>Tips</h1>
Under Windows I strongly recommend using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> as it provides a Linux like
environment, including perl and a decent shell. 
And if you are developing non GPL things <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> as the compiler, other compilers
are usable as well, but MinGW is free.<br>
